Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_18.03 Differential Equations_](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011)

Biology (GIR) ![](/images/educator/icon-question-gir.png) One of the following courses:

*   [_7.01SC Fundamentals of Biology_](/courses/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011)
*   [_7.012 Introductory Biology_](/courses/7-012-introduction-to-biology-fall-2004)
*   [_7.013 Introductory Biology_](/courses/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2013)
*   [_7.014 Introductory Biology_](/courses/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005)

Description
-----------

This course focuses on feedback control mechanisms that living organisms implement at the molecular level to execute their functions, with emphasis on techniques to design novel systems with prescribed behaviors. Students will learn how biological functions can be understood and designed using notions from feedback control.

Objectives
----------

By the end of the course, students will know these things:

1.  How to construct mathematical models of a large range of molecular mechanisms.
2.  How to use these models along with analysis and design tools from controls and dynamical systems to predict and engineer the dynamics of molecular networks.

Students are allowed one extension on a homework assignment during the semester. The lowest score on a homework assignment will be dropped i.e. will not count toward the final grade.
